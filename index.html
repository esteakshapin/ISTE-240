                <p>
                    Hey everyone! I'm Shapin, and I'm a transfer student at RIT, coming all the way from NYC. This is my first semester here, and I'm studying Web & Mobile Computing.
                    <br><br>
                    Originally, I'm from Bangladesh, but I grew up in Brooklyn for the majority of my time. I've been intrested in coding since I was pretty young, and I dream of running my own startup someday.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides coding, I love sports - especially when it comes to football. I used to play for my high school team, and I'm excited to join the RIT football club.
                    <br><br>
                    Nature is another love of mine, and I enjoy hiking, often with my brother. It's a great way to unwind and connect with the outdoors.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm looking forward to making new friends and having a fantastic time here at RIT!
                </p>
