                Rangamati, hidden within the picturesque hill district of Chittagong Hill Tracts, is a hidden gem of natural beauty. Although I have lived in Bangladesh during my childhood years, I have never known about Rangamati until my trip in 2022. This amazing vacation spot offers an escape for tourists from the hustle and bustle of life among the lush green hills and serene lakes. The best place to explore this area is to go on a boat tour, something I will never forget. You get the chance to explore the various waterfalls, sunbathe between the towering mountains and eat food at the indigenous restaurants. This mountainous area is home to various indigenous people who have adapted to life on mountains and water and you can tour their villages as part of the boat tour. Although my family and I elected not to do that, we still had an amazing time relaxing in our boat and exploring the natural beauty that Rangamati has to offer!
