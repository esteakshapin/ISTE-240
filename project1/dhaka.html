                    Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, is not only the
                    largest city in the country but also a vibrant and
                    historically significant metropolis. With a rich past,
                    iconic landmarks, and a rapidly growing population, Dhaka is
                    a city of contrasts where the old and the new coexist.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>

                <span style="vertical-align: top;">
                    Dhaka's history dates back to ancient times, but it rose to
                    prominence during the Mughal Empire in the 17th century when
                    it became the capital of Bengal. Under Mughal rule, Dhaka
                    thrived as a center of trade and culture. The city was known
                    for its exquisite Mughal architecture, including the Lalbagh
                    Fort, built by Prince Muhammad Azam, and the Ahsan Manzil,
                    the pink palace of the Nawabs.

                        style="float: right; margin-right: .5rem;">
                    During the British colonial period, Dhaka continued to play
                    a crucial role in the region's administration and economy.
                    The partition of Bengal in 1947 divided the city between
                    India and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), leading to
                    significant changes in its demographics and culture.

            <h3>Population</h3>
            <p>
                Dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities in the world,
                with a population that has grown exponentially over the years.
                Its bustling streets are a reflection of its diversity, with
                people from all over Bangladesh and various ethnic backgrounds
                coming to the city in search of opportunities.
                <br>
                The city's population growth has led to challenges in
                infrastructure, traffic congestion, and housing, but it has also
                contributed to the city's dynamic culture, lively street
                markets, and a burgeoning food scene. Dhaka is known for its
                street food, offering a wide array of delicious dishes like
                biryani, hilsa fish curry, and various sweets.

            <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
            <p>
                As a young kid, I visited Dhaka numerous times but never saw the same thing twice. It's immense size and density can't simply be articulated. It can be best described as organized chaos and is amazing to see. Being the capital of Bangladesh, the architecture is one of if not the best in the country with numerous monuments, historical buildings, and beautiful mosques. I've had the privilege of visiting the Lalbagh Fort and it was absolutely breathtaking. Its red clay like color stood out among the bustling gray of the city. Learning about its history and the years that it has endured to be still standing makes it a wonder that must be on everyone's lists.
